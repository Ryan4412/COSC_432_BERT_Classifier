Step 1: get miniconda
To get started I would suggest to download Miniconda on your device. Miniconda is a package handeler that allows you to create a mini virtual enviornmant to run applications in and can be helpful for keeping project dependencies separate from your physical device and ensure that you will not ruin other projects that you have by downloading an out-dated dependency.

this video is a helpful guide to follow to get started with Miniconda. Once you have created a conda enviormnet like how the video shows you can move on to the next step which is setting up dependencies for your conda enviornment.
